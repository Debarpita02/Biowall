# Biowall
The spacing in the buildings can be used as a vector to reduce carbon emissions. Our idea is to plant a bacteria or moss into a transparent membrane that has photosynthetic properties. This bacteria will absorb the carbon and emit oxygen or a byproduct that will not only reduce carbon emission but will help in the natural cooling of the buildings.
